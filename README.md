This build is for development purpose only. This project is not finished and is not intended for public use.

This only has some core feature.

Features in this build:
  1. Themes
  2. Plugins
  3. Installation process.
  4. Admin panel (currently serves no purpose except to activate Debugger)

If you want to contribute and you don't know where to start hit me up.

If you know what you are doing i suggest you to use Debugger plugin made for Feather CMS you can find it here https://github.com/ElStefanos/Feather-CMS-Debugger-Plugin .

This will work best on virtual host.
